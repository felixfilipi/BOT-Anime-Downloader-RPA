<h1>BOT-Anime-Downloader-RPA </h1>

This is a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) project using UiPath to build an Indonesia's subtitled anime downloader robot. With this application, you don't even need to open or do anything. Just type what anime you want, which episode (BATCH allowed), and the quality you preferred, and the robot will look what you want for itself. üòÅ

<h2>Feature</h2>

* Input your anime's title or keyword, its episode, and the quality you preferred.
* Able to download BATCH
* Automatically open and redirect you to the browser.
* Block all of the annoying ads
* 1 click download preferred
* Want to download for another round? Yes, you can.
* Etc. 

<h2>Bat Configuration</h2>

Change the directory according to your PATH environment, normally your UiRobot path will be located in this local PATH, just configure it with your own directory

 Furthermore, change the XAML PATH according to your clone location.
